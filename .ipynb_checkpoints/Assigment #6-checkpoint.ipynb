    "# Q: 1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "# OOP Concepts\n",
    "# Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Class\n",
    "# A class is a collection of method and variables. It is a blueprint that defines the data and behavior of a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let’s take Human Being as a class. A class is a blueprint for any functional entity which defines its properties and its functions. Like Human Being, having body parts, performing various actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Inheritance\n",
    "# Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows code reusability when a class includes property of another class. Considering HumanBeing a class, which has properties like hands, legs, eyes, mouth, etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "# My name is xyz, and I am an instance/object of class Man. When we say, Human Being, Man or Woman, we just mean a kind, you, your friend, and I. We are the forms of these classes. We have a physical existence while a class is just a logical definition. We are the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Abstraction\n",
    "# The concept of abstraction focuses on what an object does, instated of how an object is represented or “how it works.” Thus, data abstraction is often used for managing large and complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Encapsulation\n",
    "# Encapsulation means that we want to hide unnecessary details from the user. For example, when we call from our mobile phone, we select the number and press call button. But the entire process of calling or what happens from the moment we press or touch the call button to the moment we start having a phone conversation is hidden from us.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Polymorphism\n",
    "# Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts used to get it done. This can be done in two ways, overloading and overriding."

    "# Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "# The programmes written with OOP are really easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since everything is treated as objects, so we can model a real-world concept using OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# OOP approach offers the reusability of classes. We can reuse the classes that are already created without writing them again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since the parallel development of classes is possible in OOP concept, It results in the quick development of the complete programmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Programmes written in OOP technique are marginally easier to test, manage as well as maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is a secured development technique since data is hidden and can’t be accessed by external functions."

    "# A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
